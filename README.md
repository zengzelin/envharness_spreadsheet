## 🏴󠁶󠁵󠁭󠁡󠁰󠁿 Overview

As LLMs become autonomous agents, they learn less from curated text and more from
interactive environments. But those environments are expensive to build and, once
built, stay **static** — they behave identically no matter which agent interacts
with them or how much it has improved, so they can neither target a particular
agent's weaknesses nor keep teaching once its tasks are solved. **EnvHarness**
applies the *agent harness* idea to the other side of the interaction: just as an
agent harness makes a frozen LLM capable through plug-in components (skills,
memory, tools) without changing its weights, EnvHarness wraps a **frozen
environment** with its own plug-in components to make it dynamically controllable
— without touching the environment's internal code.

The layer is assembled from three plug-in components — **Setup** (reshape the
initial state), **Rule** (reshape the interaction: which actions are allowed,
what they do, and what the agent observes), and **Link** (compose in another
environment's tasks) — that operate strictly at the standard `reset` / `step`
interface and stack freely. They reshape only *what the agent observes, what it
may do, and where it starts*; the goal predicate that decides success is left
untouched, so every reshaped environment keeps the original benchmark's trusted,
human-built verifiers — and because nothing reaches into environment-specific
code, the same system works across domains.

<p align="center"><em>The three EnvHarness components against the environment interface.</em> The leftmost panel is a bare environment; each of the others plugs in one component — <strong>Setup</strong> (reshapes the initial state), <strong>Rule</strong> (reshapes the interaction: which actions are allowed, what they do, and what the agent observes), and <strong>Link</strong> (composes another environment's tasks in) — and highlights the interface calls it intercepts. All panels expose the same contract and leave the underlying implementation, tasks, and verifiers untouched.</p>

An LLM **designer agent** drives a diagnostic loop: it reads the
agent's trajectories to diagnose a specific weakness, writes components that
reshape the environment to target it, tests the policy in the new environment,
and revises until the environment can actually *teach* what the agent lacks. The
signal is targeted (written against diagnosed flaws) and lasting (the loop repeats
as the agent improves, co-evolving the two).

Across ALFWorld, WebArena, SWE-bench Verified, OfficeQA, and SpreadsheetBench,
skills learned in EnvHarness environments beat both the no-skill baseline and
skills learned in the original environments — more effective (up to +9 points on
held-out tasks) and more efficient (~9.8% fewer interaction steps). The same
dynamic environments also produce stronger policies under reinforcement learning,
and repeating the designer loop compounds the gains round after round.

### Key Features
* **Frozen environments, no internal edits:** the benchmark's task set, its
  dynamics and its grading stay exactly as published. Only the layer the agent
  acts *through* changes.
* **Code as the Envharness:** the designer emits real Python — a `_Rules(Rules)`
  subclass — not a selection from a fixed menu. It is compiled and executed in
  an isolated subprocess, so a bad mutation becomes a recorded trace instead of
  a dead run.
* **Composable by construction:** an `EnvHarness` *is* an `ActionableEnv` that
  wraps another one, so layers stack arbitrarily and every benchmark is driven
  through a single interface.
* **Benchmark-agnostic:** adding an environment means implementing one
  interface; the designer, the components, the loop and the evaluation stages
  need no changes.

## ⚡️ Quickstart Guide

### 0. LLM Configuration

Every stage -- corpus generation, skill induction, evaluation -- takes the same
model string, so a provider is one line of config. Three families are
supported:

- **GPT**: to use OpenAI models (`gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `o4-mini`),
  set your API key:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
  ```

- **Claude**: to use Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) on Vertex AI, set up
  Application Default Credentials (unnecessary on a GCE VM with an attached
  service account) and name your project:
  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
  pip install "google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.38"
  ```

- **Gemini**: to use Gemini models (`gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`)
  through the Gemini API, set your key:
  ```bash
  export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
  ```

Name the model wherever a config takes one -- the provider prefix selects the
backend, and `envharness.infra.model` supplies that provider's auth and
parameter handling:

```yaml
policy:
  model: openai/gpt-4.1-mini          # or gemini/... or vertex_ai/claude-...
mutator:
  type: llm
  model: vertex_ai/claude-sonnet-4-6  # the two roles can differ
```

A driver's `MODEL` env var accepts the same strings and applies to **every**
stage of that run -- corpus policy, harness agent, skill induction and
evaluation -- overriding whatever the YAML names, so a run never ends up
split across providers:

```bash
MODEL=openai/gpt-4.1 python experiments/swebench/reproduce.py
```

The same override is available directly on the Stage 1 runner:

```bash
python scripts/run_harness.py --config <corpus.yaml> --model openai/gpt-4.1-mini
```

Leave `MODEL` unset to keep the per-role models the config names -- which is
how you give the policy and the harness agent different models.

**Concurrency follows your rate limit, not your CPU.** Every benchmark runs
its tasks through a pool of workers (`CORPUS_WORKERS`, `EVAL_WORKERS`,
`EVAL_CONCURRENCY`, ... -- see each benchmark's README). The defaults suit a
modest quota; a pool large enough to saturate your provider's tokens-per-minute
tier turns into 429s that truncate episodes mid-task, which shows up as
unexpectedly low success rates rather than as an error. Raise the pool when
your quota allows, and on Gemini give it several keys (`GEMINI_API_KEYS`) --
that quota is metered per key, so the workers spread across them.

#### Embeddings

Skill retrieval needs an embedding model too. You do not normally pick one:
each provider is paired with an embedding model the *same* credentials already
reach, so setting `MODEL` is enough.

| `MODEL` provider | embedding model | dim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai/...` | `openai/text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 |
| `vertex_ai/...` | `vertex_ai/text-embedding-004` (same ADC) | 768 |
| `gemini/...` | `gemini/gemini-embedding-001` | 3072 |

`EH_EMBED_MODEL` overrides the pairing for both bank building and retrieval,
and takes any embedding model litellm supports (with that provider's own
credentials set):

```bash
EH_EMBED_MODEL=openai/text-embedding-3-small \
MODEL=vertex_ai/claude-sonnet-4-6 python experiments/alfworld/reproduce.py
```

That is also why the override exists: it holds one embedding space fixed while
the policy provider changes. A bank stores its vectors, and `Bank.retrieve`
rejects a query vector of a different width, so changing the embedding model —
including by changing provider — means rebuilding the bank.

### 1. Run a benchmark

Each benchmark has its own environment and its own one-command driver.
**Open the README in the experiment folder you want to run** — it carries the
environment setup, the run commands and the knobs for that benchmark:

- [`experiments/toy24`](experiments/toy24/README.md)
- [`experiments/alfworld`](experiments/alfworld/README.md)
- [`experiments/swebench`](experiments/swebench/README.md)
- [`experiments/webarena`](experiments/webarena/README.md)
- [`experiments/officeqa`](experiments/officeqa/README.md)
- [`experiments/spreadsheetbench`](experiments/spreadsheetbench/README.md)

Every folder follows the same shape:

```bash
python scripts/check_env.py <benchmark>           # preflight
bash experiments/<benchmark>/reproduce_smoke.sh   # the same stages, fewer tasks
python experiments/<benchmark>/reproduce.py       # the full protocol
```

The experiments above distill/evaluate **skills**. For **RL training** — a policy
trained with GRPO directly inside EnvHarness environments (via verl-agent) — see
[`rl/`](rl/README.md).



## 📊 Results

Skills induced from EnvHarness-adapted environments transfer back to the
**untouched** benchmark and beat both controls — no skills at all, and skills
induced from the original environments. All numbers are the mean over three
independent runs, with standard deviations as subscripts. A dash marks a
baseline that is benchmark-specific and cannot be applied to the other domain;
EnvHarness covers every benchmark through the same interface.

SR = success rate, AS = agent steps (lower is better), EM = exact match.
The three skill sources correspond to the conditions each `reproduce.py` prints:
`nobank` (No Skills), `orig` (Original Envs) and `ours` (EnvHarness Envs).

**Models.** Every number in both tables was produced with **Gemini**. The
configs in this repo default to `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`, so reproducing the
tables means pointing them back at Gemini:

```bash
MODEL=gemini/gemini-3.5-flash python experiments/swebench/reproduce.py
```

`MODEL` reaches every stage, embeddings included -- those runs used Gemini's
own `gemini-embedding-001`, which is what this one switch selects, so nothing
else needs setting. Alternatively edit the one `model:` line in that
benchmark's `corpus.yaml` and `reasoning_bank_eval.yaml`. Absolute numbers move
with the model; what the tables compare is skill sources at a fixed model.

## 🧱 Adding a New Benchmark

A benchmark joins EnvHarness by implementing **one interface**, `ActionableEnv`
(`reset / step / observe / evaluate / get_env_state / save_state / from_state`).
Everything downstream — the Environment Designer, the three components, the loop,
the evaluation — is benchmark-agnostic and needs no changes.

### 1. Implement the Bridge

The Bridge is the **only** layer that may know about a docker container, a
browser session, or a simulator. Subclass `ActionableEnv`, register a stable
tag, and implement the seven required methods.

`tool_registry` declares the action space. Its schemas are what the Policy is
given to act with, and what the Environment Designer is shown so a Rule's
action hook can match on `action.name`. Each entry is a `Tool` whose schema is
introspected from its `invoke` signature — see any
`envharness/bridges/*/tools.py` for the shape.

```python
# envharness/bridges/mybench/bridge.py
from envharness.core.actionable_env import ActionableEnv
from envharness.core.registry import register_env
from envharness.core.types import (
    Action, EnvResetResponse, EnvResponse, EvaluationResult, Observation,
)
from .tools import Search      # declares name="search"

@register_env("mybench")                  # tag written into save files
class MyBenchEnv(ActionableEnv):
    tool_registry = [Search]              # -> tool_schemas() for the Policy

    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None) -> EnvResetResponse:
        # The orchestrator passes the per-task identifier as `seed`; it indexes
        # into the benchmark's task library, it is not a randomness source.
        ...
        return EnvResetResponse(observation=self.observe(), info={})

    def step(self, action: Action) -> EnvResponse:
        # Dispatch on action.name -- the same names the Tools declare.
        if action.name == "search":
            result = self._search(**action.kwargs)
        else:
            result = {"error": f"unknown action {action.name!r}"}
        return EnvResponse(observation=self.observe(), reward=0.0,
                           terminated=self._done, truncated=False,
                           info={"result": result})   # by convention: info["result"]

    def observe(self) -> Observation: ...
    def evaluate(self) -> EvaluationResult: ...
    def get_env_state(self): ...          # data only -- NO runtime handles
    def save_state(self) -> dict: ...
    @classmethod
    def from_state(cls, state: dict): ...
```

Two contracts matter:

* **`get_env_state()` must carry data, never handles.** It is what the
  designer's generated hooks receive, and it crosses a subprocess boundary. A
  docker client or a browser page in there breaks both.
* **`save_state` / `from_state` are yours to define.** In-memory benchmarks can
  snapshot everything; for a container or a browser, store
  `{"reset_seed": ..., "reset_options": {...}}` and let `from_state` re-run
  `reset` — valid at episode boundaries, which is where checkpoints are taken.
  Override `close()` if there is external state to release; subprocess death
  does not free it for you.

### 2. Describe the state to the Environment Designer

`env_state_schema()` is injected verbatim into the designer's prompt. It is the
*only* thing telling it which fields its generated hooks may read, so be
explicit:

```python
    @classmethod
    def env_state_schema(cls) -> str:
        return ("MyBenchState = {\n"
                "  query: str,          # the task's question\n"
                "  hits: list[str],     # results of the last search\n"
                "  submitted: bool,\n"
                "}")
```

Optional hooks, all with safe defaults: `list_tasks()` (enables agent-driven
task selection), `notify_replay_complete()` (rewind per-episode counters after
a `Setup` replay), `default_reset_args()` / `reset_after_load()` (checkpoint
loading), `step_reward()` (dense per-step signal; non-fatal).

### 3. Point a corpus config at it

Corpus generation needs no new code — `scripts/run_harness.py` is
bridge-agnostic. Copy the closest existing `corpus.yaml` and change the import
path:

```yaml
env:
  import_path: envharness.bridges.mybench.bridge:MyBenchEnv
  reset_options: { ... }                 # forwarded to your reset()
policy:
  client_factory: envharness.infra.llm:LiteLLMClient
  client_kwargs: { model: openai/gpt-4.1-mini }
  action_format: function_calling        # or think_action for single-tool text
objective:
  type: difficulty_zone
  target_band: [0.4, 0.6]
```

Verify it boots before spending a run:

```bash
python -c "from envharness.bridges.mybench.bridge import MyBenchEnv; MyBenchEnv(); print('OK')"
python scripts/run_harness.py --config experiments/mybench/corpus.yaml --n-tasks 1
```

### 4. Reuse the downstream stages

Skill induction and evaluation are shared. `scripts/induce_pair.py` works
unchanged on per-task rollouts; write a benchmark-local `induce.py` only when the
induction prompt needs domain phrasing. For the evaluation, copy the driver
closest to your grading style — they differ only in how they load tasks and score
them. Then chain the stages in a `reproduce.py` mirroring an existing one.

### 5. Add a preflight target and a test

Add a `check_<bench>()` to `scripts/check_env.py` and register it in `CHECKS`,
so a missing dependency or dataset fails loudly before a run rather than
silently grading everything as failure. Then copy
`tests/test_actionable_env_toy24.py` — it walks the whole `ActionableEnv`
contract, including a `save_state` / `from_state` round-trip, and needs no GPU,
docker, or API key:

```bash
pytest
```

## 🔩 Adding a Harness Layer

The three components ship as three layer classes: `Setup` (reshape the initial
state — replays a fixed action list on every reset), `Rules` (reshape the
interaction — per-step hooks on the inner env's actions / transition /
observation), and `Link` (compose another environment's tasks into the episode).
A new layer is how you add a capability those do not cover — reward shaping,
budget accounting, anything that belongs *between* the agent and the environment.

Because an `EnvHarness` **is** an `ActionableEnv` that wraps one, layers stack
arbitrarily and nothing above or below needs to know how many there are.

### 1. Subclass and register

```python
from envharness.core.actionable_env import ActionableEnv
from envharness.core.envharness import EnvHarness
from envharness.core.registry import register_harness
from envharness.core.types import Action, EnvResponse

@register_harness("budget")                 # tag written into save files
class Budget(EnvHarness):
    def __init__(self, inner: ActionableEnv | None = None, max_steps: int = 50):
        super().__init__(inner)
        self.max_steps = max_steps
        self._n = 0

    # Override ONLY the methods this layer affects. reset / step / observe /
    # evaluate / get_env_state / step_reward all delegate to `inner` by
    # default, so a single-axis layer is a single method.
    def step(self, action: Action) -> EnvResponse:
        resp = self.inner.step(action)
        self._n += 1
        if self._n >= self.max_steps:
            resp = EnvResponse(observation=resp.observation, reward=resp.reward,
                               terminated=resp.terminated, truncated=True,
                               info={**resp.info, "budget_exhausted": True})
        return resp

    def save_state(self) -> dict:
        return {"max_steps": self.max_steps}        # THIS layer's fields only

    @classmethod
    def from_state(cls, state: dict, inner: ActionableEnv | None = None):
        return cls(inner=inner, max_steps=state.get("max_steps", 50))
```

Three contracts:

* **`save_state` returns only this layer's own fields.** The persistence walker
  saves the inner env and every other layer separately, and emits
  `harnesses: [innermost, ..., outermost]` — index 0 sits closest to the
  environment, the last entry is what the agent sees.
* **`from_state` takes an extra `inner`.** This is a deliberate divergence from
  `ActionableEnv.from_state`: a layer is meaningless without something to wrap,
  and the loader supplies it while rebuilding the stack inner-to-outer.
* **The tag is your on-disk format.** Once a checkpoint is written with it,
  renaming it invalidates those files.

### 2. Put it in a stack

Any checkpoint naming your tag now loads, because `load` resolves tags through
the registry rather than through import paths:

```json
{
  "env":       {"type": "mybench", "state": {"reset_seed": 12, "reset_options": {}}},
  "harnesses": [{"type": "setup", "state": {"actions": [...]}},
                {"type": "budget", "state": {"max_steps": 30}}]
}
```

For a corpus run, note that a `Candidate` carries exactly two levers —
`rules_code` and `in_env_actions` — so the episode runner composes `Setup` and
`Rules` and nothing else. To have the Environment Designer emit your layer
directly, extend `Candidate`, `build_env_stack` in
`envharness/orchestration/runner.py`, and the designer's propose schema in
`envharness/agents/harness_agent.py`. Until then the layer is usable by hand,
from a checkpoint, or wherever you build the stack yourself.

### 3. Test the composition

`tests/test_envharness_composition.py` is the template: it stacks layers around
a toy env and asserts the pass-through invariants (an un-overridden method must
reach the inner env unchanged) plus the save/load round-trip of the whole stack.
`tests/test_link_envagnostic.py` additionally shows how to prove a layer only
ever touches the ABC, by composing two dummy envs with deliberately different
action and observation shapes.
